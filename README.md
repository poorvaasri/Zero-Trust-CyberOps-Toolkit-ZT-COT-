# 🔐 Zero Trust CyberOps Toolkit (ZT-COT)

An interactive, terminal-based cybersecurity simulation toolkit inspired by Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), designed for practical learning in ethical hacking, security operations, and advanced threat detection.

## Project Overview

The **Zero Trust CyberOps Toolkit (ZT-COT)** is a self-contained, Python-based simulation platform that emulates the operations of an enterprise-grade Security Operations Center (SOC). Built with a strong focus on Zero Trust principles, ZT-COT allows users to experience modern security practices in a safe and offline-compatible environment.

## Key Features

*  **MFA Brute Force Simulator** – Tests OTP security against automated attacks.
*  **Live Packet Sniffer** – Captures and analyzes network traffic.
*  **Port Scanner** – Discovers open ports on target machines.
*  **MAC Spoofing Detection** – Identifies unauthorized devices.
*  **SSH Honeypot** – Detects unauthorized remote access attempts.
*  **File Integrity Monitoring** – Flags changes to critical files.
*  **Insider Threat Tracker** – Monitors and reports internal threats.
*  **Hash Reversal Module** – Demonstrates password cracking.
*  **SOC Dashboard** – Real-time visualization of alerts and logs.
*  **Firewall Simulator** – Models Zero Trust access control rules.
*  **Report Generator** – Summarizes security module activity and findings.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Language**: Python 3.x
* **Platform**: Windows 10/11 or Kali Linux
* **Interface**: Terminal-based (CLI)
* **Dependencies**: Standard Python libraries (no external APIs required)
* **File System**: JSON-based simulation storage (`cyber_sim_data.json`)

## System Requirements

### Hardware

* CPU: Multi-core processor
* RAM: 4GB minimum
* Network: Active Wi-Fi/Ethernet interface

### Software

* Python 3.x
* Visual Studio Code / Notepad++ / Terminal Emulator
* PowerShell, Git Bash (Windows) or Bash (Linux)
